# Web Scrapping API

### A web scrapping Api that scrapes data from the SAPS website about missing people. It returns their name, picture and a link to the SAPS website to see more about the individual.

#### Tools
  - Axios for fetching the URL
  - Cheerio for returning the actual data
  - Express with TypeScript

### Key features of the scraper:

- Efficient DOM Traversing: Leveraging Cheerioâ€™s jQuery-like syntax, Iâ€™ve built a robust solution to parse and extract data.
- Dynamic Data Handling: The scraper intelligently handles complex structures, including nested tables and images, making it versatile for multiple use cases.
- Customizable Extraction: Data extraction can be customized based on classes, attributes, or even nested elements, providing flexibility for varied scraping needs.
  
This tool opens up new possibilities for automated data gathering and analysis. Looking forward to applying it to real-world projects and seeing how it can streamline data processes! ðŸ’¡
